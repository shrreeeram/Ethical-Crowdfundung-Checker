Ethical Reasoning for Crowdfunding Checker Project

This project implements basic ethical safeguards to ensure trust in a crowdfunding platform:

1. Fund Limit Rule:
   Campaigns requesting unrealistic or extremely high amounts are flagged to prevent scams.

2. Address Requirement:
   Submissions without a valid address are rejected, helping ensure traceability.

3. Company Verification:
   BeautifulSoup is used to check whether the provided company name exists in a trusted list.
   This helps reduce fake organization entries.

4. Admin Review:
   Final decision to approve or reject lies with a human reviewer to balance automation and fairness.

These rules protect donors from fraud while being fair to genuine campaigners.
